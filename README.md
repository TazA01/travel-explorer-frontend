<h1>Travel Explorer Frontend</h1> 

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Travel Explorer is a react app that allows a user to choose their travel preferences from a form and using their choices, it generates a list of 5 random 
cities in the world along with <=30 places in that city that match the user's preferences they entered in the form. The user is then able to save the cities
they are interested in and are also able to go into their saved cities and delete a city from that list.
